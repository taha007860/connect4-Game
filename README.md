# connect4-Game
This is a Connect4 game designed using C language with a Monte Carlo bot implementation. The game is played on a 6x7 grid with two players, red and yellow. The objective of the game is to connect four of your colored discs in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally while preventing your opponent from doing the same.  The game can be played in two modes, human vs human or human vs bot. The bot is implemented using the Monte Carlo algorithm, which is a probabilistic method used in mathematics and computer science. The Monte Carlo algorithm works by simulating many random games to determine the best possible move to make.  The bot is designed to make intelligent moves based on the current state of the game and the probability of winning. This Connect4 game with Monte Carlo bot is a fun and challenging way to test your skills against an intelligent opponent. The game is easy to play and can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The code is available on GitHub for anyone who wants to explore and modify the game
